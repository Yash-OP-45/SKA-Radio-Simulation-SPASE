Right Ascension (or "RA") and Declination (or "Dec") 
are <i>global</i> coordinates:
any particular star has the same RA and Dec for all
observers on Earth, and that position remains the
same, night after night.
Altitude and Azimuth, on the other hand,
are <i>local</i> coordinates:
each observer sets up his own reference frame.
Moreover, the altitude and azimuth of a 
given star will change over just a few minutes as
the star appears to rise, move across the sky, 
and set.

<h4>
Right Ascension and Declination
</h4>

<P>
On Earth, one way to describe a location is with a coordinate
system which is fixed to the Earth's surface.

<P>
<img src="./earth_coord.gif" width=530 height=399>

<P>
The system is oriented by the spin axis of the Earth,
and has special points at the North and South Poles.
We use lines of 
<b>latitude</b> and <b>longitude</b>
to demarcate the surface.
It's obvious that latitude is measured away from the equator.
But where is the starting point for longitude?
There is no "obvious" choice.
After a lot of dickering,
European nations finally decided to use the 
location of the Greenwich Observatory in England
as the starting point for longitude.

<P>
There are several ways to specify a location --
for example, that of the RIT Observatory.
One can use degrees:
<pre><font size=+1>
 latitude 43.0758 degrees North, longitude 77.6647 degrees West of Greenwich
</font></pre>

<P>
Or degrees, minutes and seconds:
<pre><font size=+1>
 latitude 43:04:33 North, longitude 77:39:53 West 
</font></pre>

<P>
Or, in the case of longitude, one can measure in time zones.
The sun will set at the RIT Observatory about 5 hours and 11 minutes
later than it does at Greenwich, 
so one could say
<pre><font size=+1>
 latitude 43:04:33 North, longitude 05 hours 11 minutes West
</font></pre>


<P>
<h4>
The celestial coordinates
</h4>

<P>
On can make a similar coordinate system which is "fixed
to the sky":
<P>
<img src="./sky_coord.gif" width=736 height=549>

<P>
Once again, we use the Earth's rotation axis to orient the
coordinates.
There are two special places, the North and South Celestial 
Poles.
As the Earth rotates (to the East), 
the celestial sphere appears to rotate (to the West).
Stars appear to move in circles:
small ones near the celestial poles, and large ones close to the 
celestial equator:

<P>
We again use two orthogonal coordinates to describe a
position:
<UL>
<LI> <b>Declination</b>, like a celestial latitude
<LI> <b>Right Ascension</b>, like a celestial longitude
</UL>
As with latitude, Declination is measured away from the celestial equator.
But there is again no obvious choice for the starting point of the
other set of coordinates.
Where should we start counting Right Ascension?
The rather arbitrary choice made by astronomers long ago was
to pick the point at which the Sun appears to cross the 
celestial equator from South to North as it moves through the
sky during the course of a year.
We call that point the "vernal equinox".

<P>
<img src="./sun_ecliptic_small.gif" width=445 height=444>
<img src="./sun_ecliptic_2_small.gif" width=445 height=444>

<P>
Once again, there are several ways to express a location.
The star Sirius, for example, can be described as at

<pre><font size=+1>
  Right Ascension 101.287 degrees, Declination -16.716 degrees
</font> </pre>


<P>
We can also express the Declination in Degrees:ArcMinutes:ArcSeconds,
just as we do for latitude;
and, as usual, there are 360 degrees around a full circle.
For Right Ascension, astronomers always use the convention of
Hours:Minutes:Seconds.
There are 24 hours of RA around a circle in the sky,
because it takes 24 hours for the Sun to move all the 
way from sunrise to the next sunrise.

<pre><font size=+1>
  Right Ascension 06:45:09, Declination -16:42:58
</font></pre>
meaning
<UL>
<LI> the Right Ascension is 6 hours, 45 minutes, 09 seconds
<LI> the Declination is -16 degrees, 42 arcminutes, 58 arcseconds
</UL>

<P>
What's the difference between an "arcminute" and a "minute"?
Units with the prefix "arc" refer to 
geometric angles:
<UL>
<LI> a circle is divided into 360 degrees
 <UL>
 <LI> one degree is divided into 60 arcminutes
  <UL>
  <LI> one arcminutes is divided into 60 arcseconds.
      Therefore, there are 3600 arcseconds in one degree
  </UL>
 </UL>
</UL>

<P>
On the other hand, a "minute" without the "arc" refers
to the distance moved by an object due to the Earth's
rotation.
The Earth takes (roughly) 24 hours to rotate, 
so 

<UL>
<LI> 24 hours of time make a complete circle
<UL>
  <LI> one hour of time is divided into 60 minutes of time
   <UL>
   <LI> one minute of time is divided into 60 seconds of time.
      Therefore, there are 3600 seconds of time in one hour of time
   </UL>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>
On the celestial equator, one hour of time
corresponds to 15 degrees.
However, far from the celestial equator,
the distance an object moves in one hour
can be much smaller.

<h4>
Altitude and Azimuth
</h4>
These two coordinates,
<b>altitude</b> (or "alt") 
and 
<b>azimuth</b> (or "az"),
are centered on the observer.


<P>
<img src="./altaz.gif" width=779 height=449>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Altitude is the angular distance of an object
         above the local horizon.
         It ranges from 0 degrees at the horizon
         to 90 degrees at the <b>zenith</b>, the 
         spot directly overhead.
<LI> Azimuth is the angular distance of an object
         from the local North, measured along the horizon.
         An object which is due North has azimuth = 0 degrees;
         due East is azimuth = 90 degrees;
         due South is azimuth = 180 degrees; 
         due West is azimuth = 270 degrees.
</UL>

<P>
These two angles specify uniquely the direction of
any object in the sky.
Some telescopes have
<b>alt-az mounts</b>
which swivel in these two perpendicular axes;
camera tripods and tank turrets are other examples
of alt-az devices.

<P>
The altitude of an object is especially important from
an practical point of view:
any object which has an altitude less than zero is below
the horizon, and hence inaccessible.
Moreover, the altitude of an object is related to its
<b>airmass</b>,
a measure of how much air the light from that object
must traverse to reach the observer.
The larger the airmass, the more light is scattered or 
absorbed by the atmosphere, and hence the fainter an
object will appear.
We'll deal with airmass at greater length a bit later.


<P>
However, note that two observers at different locations on Earth
will not agree on the (alt, az) position of an object.
Moreover, as the Earth rotates, an object in the sky appears to 
move from East to West,
so its (alt, az) position changes from moment to moment.

<P>
It is possible to convert from (RA, Dec) to (alt, az), or vice versa.
One needs to know two factors:
<UL>
<LI> the location of the observer on Earth
<LI> the time of the observation
</UL>
The calculations involve some spherical trigonometry.
One can find the details in any good book on celestial mathematics,
such as

<UL>
<LI> <i>Textbook on Spherical Astronomy</i> by W. M. Smart
<LI> <i>Computational Spherical Astronomy</i> by L. G. Taff
<LI> <i>Spherical Astronomy</i> by R. M. Green
<LI> <i>Practical Astronomy with your Calculator</i> by P. J. Duffet-Smith
<LI> <i>Astronomical Formulae for Calculators</i> by J. Meeus
</UL>

<P>
In these modern times, it's usually easiest to use one
of the many fine planetarium programs on a computer to 
do this work.

<a name="trig">
<h4>
A very little spherical trigonometry
</h4>

<P>
You've learned trigonometry in high school: 
sines, cosines, the Pythagorean Theorem, and all that jazz.
However, unless you went to a <i>really</i> good high school,
you probably restricted your calculations to planar geometry.
Unfortunately, the sky is not a plane.  We measure
positions and coordinates on the inner surface of an imaginary
sphere.  
That means that the old rules don't always work anymore.
The subject of <b>spherical trigonometry</b> is not a simple one,
but, in this course, we will only peek into it.

<P>
Given two vectors, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, what is the distance
between them?
On a plane, we can break up each vector into its components
and use the Pythagorean theorem:
<P>
<center>
<img src="./eqn1.gif" width=502 height=107>
</center>

<P>
Along the surface of the celestial sphere, 
if we want to find the <i>angular separation</i> 
between two points <b>p1</b> and <b>p2</b>, 
we need to use the law of cosines.
In the usual case, the two points are expressed
in Right Ascension (&alpha;) and Declination (&delta;), like so:
<P>
<center>
<img src="./two_points.gif" width=298 height=134>
</center>

<P>
In this case, 
the law of cosines becomes
<P>
<img src="./eqn2.gif" width=960 height=54>
<P>
which gives us the cosine of the desired
angular distance &gamma;.

<P>
If we are interested in very small angular distances
on the sky -- the separation between the two components of
a binary star, for example, or the distance between two
of the moons of Jupiter --
then there are two common approximations.
First, if we start with the RA and Dec coordinates of the two points,
we can make a pseudo-Pythagorean formula; all we have to do is
correct the difference in Right Ascension with the cosine
of the Declination.
<P>
<center>
<img src="./pseudo_pythag.gif" width=538 height=77>
</center>

<P>
Second, if we start with a picture of some very small region
of the sky, together with an indication of the scale
in arcseconds, like this:
<P>
<img src="./3C273_scale.jpg" width=504 height=484>
<P>
then we can
<UL>
<LI> pick any two orthogonal directions on the picture
<LI> measure the separation (in arcseconds) in each direction
<LI> use the good old Pythagorean formula
</UL>
